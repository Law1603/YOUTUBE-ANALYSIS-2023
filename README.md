# Limitations
•	Correlation vs. Causation: The project may identify correlations between different variables, such as the relationship between earnings and unemployment rates or video views and subscribers. However, identifying causal relationships is more complex. For example, observing that high-earning YouTubers are predominantly from countries with low unemployment rates does not necessarily mean that low unemployment causes high YouTube earnings. Without controlled experiments or deeper statistical analysis, the project may be limited in its ability to draw definitive causal conclusions.
